## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a pretty good usesace of media queries, practicing that was pretty helpful. Also building a pixel perfect designes is a sometimes hard to do as different websites render things differently, so in this case there was some problems with that, but I fixed it with lots of research, which made me analyze display: inline, block elements even mmore.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
