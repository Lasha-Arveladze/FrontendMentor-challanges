## My process

First I analyzed the structure of the given example. Create a variables from given style-guide. As it was one dimensional layout I though Flex-box would be a best way to go and built it using this tool.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped my to strengthen my skills in html and css. I learned using variables in css and used mobile-first workflow for the first time.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these shills.
