### What I learned

This Project was first big project of my carrer, where I have to combine all of the skills I had into one project. This was pretty good exercise in how to plan a project from scratch till the end, which techniques to use to save lots of time and lines of code. Also, helped me to solidify my understanding in positioning images, (absolute, relative).

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
