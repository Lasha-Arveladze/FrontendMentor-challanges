## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This Project was another exercise for my HTML and CSS skills. I've once more used mobile-first workflow, Flexbox, Grid, positioning elements and other advanced CSS techniques. I have also learned how to make curve edges, like you can see in this landing page, which made it as a "Future" type website.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
