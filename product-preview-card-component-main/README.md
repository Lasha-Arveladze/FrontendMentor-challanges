## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was pretty good example of how powerful is grid. This approeach saved a lot of time and lots of lines of code to transform it into responsive website and practicing that was a valuable lesson.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
