### What I learned

This project served as an exercise to enhance my HTML and CSS skills to a significantly higher level. It presented numerous complex layout challenges and required adaptability across various screen sizes. As a result, I successfully developed a pixel-perfect design and acquired several new techniques.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
