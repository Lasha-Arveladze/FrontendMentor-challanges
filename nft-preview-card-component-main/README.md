## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project one of the most challenging part for me was the hover state on the img, but with a research and a little help of AI I managed to achieve desired outcome and one that's more important I learnt the "tactic" to overcome these kinds of problems in the future.

### Continued development

I want to develop HTML & CSS skills even more, so next projects will only focus on these skills.
